Welcome to EST's documentation!
===============================

EST is a library born for a Master Thesis at University of Pisa with the aim of studying the effect 
of noise on the dynamical evolution of entanglement.

EST stands for Entanglement Survival Time. The aim of this project was the derivation and analysis of EST
distributions for a system of two maximally entangled qubits subjected to the action of an ensemble of (local) 
Markovian noises (a realistic model that is commonly used to represent the action of an external 
environment that acts on the system without keeping track of the history of the dynamical process).
The main source of inspiration for this project were the following works:

* Gatto D., De Pasquale A., and Giovannetti V., Degradation of Entanglement in Markovian Noise, Phys. Rev. A, Vol. 99, N. 3, 2019, 032307.

* Denisov S., Laptyeva T., Tarnowski W., Chruściński D., and Życzkowski K., Universal Spectra of Random Lindblad Operators, Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 123, N. 14, 2019, 140403.
